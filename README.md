# Covariant Particle Transformer

This repository is forked from [this Github](https://github.com/shikaiqiu/Covariant-Particle-Transformer), which is the official repository for the code and pretrained models of ["A Holistic Approach to Predicting Top Quark Kinematic Properties with the Covariant Particle Transformer"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05687.pdf).  The Jupyter notebook ```LabelingWithoutMatching.ipynb``` shows how the regression tools from the CPT paper can be re-used for jet labeling and includes the plots for the paper "Parton Labeling without Matching: Unveiling Emergent Labelling Capabilities in Regression Models".  All the other instructions below are unchanged from the CPT GitHub.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the environment, download pretrained models, and download datasets used in the paper:

1. **Set up conda environment and install dependencies**:
```
sh setup.sh
conda activate cpt
```
2. **(Optional) Download pretrained $ttH$ and $tttt$ models**:

The script also downloads model predictions on all datasets used in the paper.
```
sh download_pretrained.sh
```

3. **(Optional) Download datasets**:
Note the $ttH$ and $tttt$ dataset is ~30GB in size each, while the other datasets are smaller. You can comment out the lines in `download_datasets.sh` to download only the datasets you need.

```
sh download_datasets.sh
```
The current implementation of our datasets are not well-optimized for speed or size. We encourage making your own datasets and modifying the data processing code in ```dataset.py``` and ```utils.py``` to suit your needs.

## Usage
To use the pretrained models, refer to the Jupyter notebooks ```pretrained_ttH.ipynb``` or ```pretrained_tttt.ipynb```.
To train a new model, use the ```train.ipynb``` Jupyter notebook.
